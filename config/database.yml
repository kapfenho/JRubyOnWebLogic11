# If you are using mssql, derby, hsqldb, or h2 with one of the
# ActiveRecord JDBC adapters, install the appropriate driver, e.g.,:
#   gem install activerecord-jdbcmssql-adapter
#
# Configure using Gemfile:
#   gem 'activerecord-jdbcmssql-adapter'
#
#development:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: JRubyOnWebLogic11
#  password:
#  host: localhost
#  database: JRubyOnWebLogic11_development
#
# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
#
#test:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: JRubyOnWebLogic11
#  password:
#  host: localhost
#  database: JRubyOnWebLogic11_test
#
#production:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: JRubyOnWebLogic11
#  password:
#  host: localhost
#  database: JRubyOnWebLogic11_production

# If you are using oracle, db2, sybase, informix or prefer to use the plain
# JDBC adapter, configure your database setting as the example below (requires
# you to download and manually install the database vendor's JDBC driver .jar
# file). See your driver documentation for the apropriate driver class and
# connection string:

development:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: 
  password: 
  driver: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
  url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@databasehost:1521:SID

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

test:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: 
  password:
  driver: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
  url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@databasehost:1521:SID

production:
  # adapter: jdbc
  # username:
  # password:
  # driver: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
  # url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@databasehost:1521:SID
  adapter: jdbc
  jndi: jdbc/jrubytest_prod_ds
